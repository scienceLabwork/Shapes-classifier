## Doodle Shape Classification
This repository contains the code for the Doodle Shape Classification project. The project aims to classify doodles into 3 different categories: Circle, Triangle, and Square. The dataset used for this project is the [Quick, Draw! Dataset](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data). The dataset contains 50 million drawings across 345 categories. The dataset was preprocessed to extract the drawings of the 3 categories mentioned above. The drawings were then converted to images and used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The model was trained using the TensorFlow framework. The trained model was then used to classify new doodles into one of the 3 categories.
